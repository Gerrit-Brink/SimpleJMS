# Simple JMS
This is a easy to use drop in JMS implementation consisting of 3 short classes.
It is single threaded and allows for scheduling as well as direct messages.
Messages are always persisted meaning that if the application stops it recovers and continues processing again.

See Test.java for creating messages and registering consumers
